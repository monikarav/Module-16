# AVL tree

## AIM :

To construct an AVL tree using the elements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 25, and print the nodes using appropriate built-in functions.

## ALGORITHM :

Step 1: Define a class for AVL tree nodes that includes data, height, left, and right pointers.

Step 2: Implement AVL tree insertion which maintains the height-balanced property.

Step 3: Define utility functions such as:

a) Getting height of a node.

b) Right and left rotations. c] Getting balance factor.

Step 4: Insert the elements: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25.

Step 5: Perform an in-order traversal to print the nodes of the AVL tree.

## PROGRAM:

```
from TreeAVL.AVL import AVL  

def getDictTree(self):
 return self.dict_tree

def Construct_AVL(L):
    tree=AVL(L)
    print(getDictTree(tree))
L=[10 ,20, 30, 40, 50, 25]
```

## RESULT :

Thus the construction an AVL tree using the elements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 25, and print the nodes using appropriate built-in functions was successfully executed.
